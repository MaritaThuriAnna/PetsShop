          <h1>Nutrition</h1>
          <p>Ragdoll cats need a well-balanced diet tailored to their life stage, with high-quality commercial cat food preferred over homemade diets. Look for cat foods that list meat as the first ingredient and avoid those with fillers or artificial additives. It's important to consult a veterinarian to determine if wet or dry food is best for your Ragdoll and introduce any dietary changes gradually to prevent digestive issues. Feeding 3-4 small meals a day is generally recommended.</p>

          <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
          <p>
            Ragdoll cats are known for their affectionate and easygoing nature, making them wonderful companions. To keep your Ragdoll happy and healthy, make sure to provide plenty of interactive playtime to satisfy their natural hunting instincts and maintain their physical health. Regular grooming is also essential due to their long, silky fur, which can become matted without proper care. Brush them at least a few times a week to prevent tangles and reduce shedding. Additionally, Ragdolls are social creatures who thrive on human interaction, so be sure to give them plenty of love and attention.
