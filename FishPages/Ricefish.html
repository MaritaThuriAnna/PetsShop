        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Ricefish, also known as Medaka, are small, freshwater fish native to Japan. They are valued for their hardiness and adaptability, making them an excellent choice for beginners and experienced aquarists alike. Ricefish come in various colors and patterns, adding vibrancy to any aquarium.
        </p>
        <p>
          These fish are known for their peaceful nature and can be kept in community tanks with other non-aggressive species. They thrive in a well-planted tank with plenty of swimming space and are relatively easy to care for, making them a popular choice for home aquariums.

        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <p>
          Ricefish thrive on a diet of high-quality flake or pellet food that is specially formulated for small freshwater fish. They also enjoy occasional live or frozen foods, such as daphnia or brine shrimp, which provide essential nutrients and enrichment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feed them small amounts several times a day, ensuring they eat within a few minutes to prevent overfeeding and maintain water quality. A balanced diet will help them stay healthy and vibrant.

        <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
        <p>
          1. Tank Size: Ricefish do well in tanks of at least 10 gallons. Providing a larger tank with ample swimming space and hiding spots will keep them healthy and happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Water Quality: Regular water changes of 10-20% weekly are essential to maintain good water quality. Use a quality filter and monitor water parameters to keep the environment stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Temperature: Keep the water temperature between 68¬∞F and 78¬∞F. Ricefish are adaptable to a range of temperatures but thrive best in a stable, slightly warmer environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Tank Mates: Ricefish are peaceful and can be kept with other small, non-aggressive fish. Avoid aggressive species or fish that may outcompete them for food.
