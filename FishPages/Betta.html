        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are a popular species due to their vibrant colors and long, flowing fins. Native to Southeast Asia, bettas were historically found in shallow waters such as rice paddies, ponds, and slow-moving streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bettas are known for their territorial nature, especially the males, which will fight other males if housed together. Their unique ability to breathe air directly from the surface via a labyrinth organ allows them to survive in low-oxygen environments. Bettas can live up to 3-5 years in captivity with proper care and environment.
        </p>

        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <p>
          Betta fish are carnivorous and require a protein-rich diet. High-quality betta pellets should be the staple of their diet, formulated specifically for their nutritional needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bettas also enjoy live or frozen food, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia, which should be provided as a supplement to enhance their health and coloration. Feed bettas sparingly, 2-3 times a day, with small amounts to prevent overeating and tank contamination.

        <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
        <p>
          1. Tank Size: While bettas can survive in small bowls, they thrive best in tanks of at least 5 gallons, providing enough space to swim and explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Water Quality: Keep water clean and maintain a temperature of 76¬∞F to 82¬∞F. Bettas are sensitive to poor water quality, so regular water changes are essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Tank Mates: Bettas can coexist with peaceful, non-fin-nipping fish such as snails, shrimp, or certain small tetras. Avoid housing multiple males together due to their aggression.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Stimulation: Bettas enjoy exploring their environment, so providing plants, hiding spots, and a gentle water filter will keep them happy and healthy.
