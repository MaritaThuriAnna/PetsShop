        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Gouramis are colorful and peaceful freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia. They come in a variety of species, each with unique colors and patterns, making them a popular choice for home aquariums. Gouramis are known for their labyrinth organ, which allows them to breathe air from the surface, making them well-suited for a range of aquatic environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          These fish are generally hardy and adaptable, but they prefer a well-planted tank with calm water. Gouramis are social and can be kept in groups, though it is essential to provide enough space and hiding spots to reduce territorial behavior among males.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <p>
          Gouramis thrive on a diet of high-quality fish flakes or pellets that are specifically formulated for freshwater fish. They also benefit from occasional live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp or bloodworms, to enhance their diet and promote vibrant colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is crucial to feed them small amounts two to three times a day, ensuring they eat all the food within a few minutes to avoid overfeeding and water quality issues. A varied diet helps maintain their health and vitality.

        <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
        <p>
          1. Tank Size: Gouramis prefer a spacious tank of at least 20 gallons with plenty of plants and hiding spots to create a comfortable environment and reduce stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Water Quality: Maintain clean water with regular water changes of 10-20% weekly. Gouramis are sensitive to poor water quality, so a good filtration system is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Temperature: Keep the water temperature between 74¬∞F and 78¬∞F. Gouramis are tropical fish and thrive in stable, warm temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Tank Mates: Gouramis are generally peaceful and can be kept with other non-aggressive species. Avoid housing them with overly aggressive fish, and be cautious with multiple males in the same tank to prevent conflicts.
