        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Goldfish are small, ornamental freshwater fish known for their vibrant colors and graceful swimming. Originating from East Asia, they have been bred in captivity for centuries, resulting in a variety of breeds and colors. Goldfish are popular in home aquariums and outdoor ponds due to their hardiness and relatively low maintenance requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          These fish are social creatures and thrive in groups, making them a great choice for community tanks. They have a lifespan of up to 10-15 years in a well-maintained environment, though some varieties can live even longer. Goldfish are also known for their ability to adapt to various water conditions, but they do best in cooler temperatures and clean water.

        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <p>
          Goldfish primarily feed on specialized fish flakes or pellets that are designed to meet their nutritional needs. These foods provide essential vitamins and minerals that promote healthy growth and vibrant colors. It's important to avoid overfeeding, as excess food can lead to water quality issues and health problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supplementing their diet with occasional treats such as live or frozen foods, like bloodworms or daphnia, can add variety and enrich their diet. Be sure to choose high-quality food that is appropriate for goldfish to ensure they receive a balanced diet.

        <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
        <p>
          1. Tank Size: Goldfish require ample space to thrive, so opt for a tank of at least 20 gallons for a single goldfish and 10 additional gallons for each additional fish. Larger tanks help maintain water quality and provide plenty of swimming space.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Water Quality: Regularly check and maintain water quality by performing weekly water changes of 10-20%. Goldfish produce a lot of waste, so a good filtration system is crucial to keep the water clean and the fish healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Temperature: Goldfish prefer cooler water temperatures between 65¬∞F and 75¬∞F. Avoid placing the tank near heat sources or in direct sunlight to prevent temperature fluctuations.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Feeding: Feed goldfish specialized pellets or flakes designed for their dietary needs. Offer small amounts several times a day, ensuring they eat within a few minutes to prevent overfeeding and water pollution.
