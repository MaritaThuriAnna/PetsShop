        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Angelfish are one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish due to their unique triangular shape and elegant, flowing fins. Native to the Amazon River in South America, these fish thrive in slow-moving waters and are known for their adaptability in captivity. Angelfish come in a variety of colors and patterns, making them a visually appealing addition to any home aquarium.
        </p>
        <p>
          In their natural habitat, angelfish prefer heavily planted areas with plenty of hiding spots. They are generally peaceful but can become territorial during breeding. Angelfish can live for up to 10 years in a well-maintained aquarium and typically grow up to 6 inches in length, making them a mid-sized fish suitable for medium to large tanks.

        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <p>
          Angelfish are omnivores, meaning they require a balanced diet of both plant and animal-based foods. In captivity, a high-quality flake or pellet food formulated for tropical fish should serve as their primary diet. To keep them healthy and vibrant, it‚Äôs essential to supplement their diet with live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, or daphnia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, angelfish enjoy eating fresh vegetables, such as spinach or blanched peas, which can be offered once or twice a week. It's important to feed angelfish small amounts of food multiple times a day to prevent overfeeding and maintain water quality in the tank.

        <h1>Tips & Tricks</h1>
        <p>
          1. Tank Size: Angelfish need plenty of swimming space, so a minimum tank size of 20 gallons is recommended for a pair. For larger groups, aim for 55 gallons or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Water Quality: Maintain a stable water temperature between 75¬∞F and 82¬∞F and keep the pH between 6.5 and 7.5. Perform regular water changes to prevent the buildup of harmful toxins.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Tank Mates: Angelfish can live with other peaceful fish, but avoid housing them with smaller fish, such as neon tetras, which they may eat. Good tank mates include other medium-sized fish like gouramis or peaceful barbs.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Breeding: Angelfish are egg-layers, and when ready to breed, they will pair off. Provide flat surfaces like broad leaves or slate for egg laying. Watch out for increased aggression during this time, as they become protective of their eggs.
